Distributed creativity



VR-in-VR project with Graham. model-driven engineering, direct editing of ASTs, the Alicenode state editor

Love how much face-to-face interaction there is on the engineering team. By exposing what people are working on, the web app / collab tools shouldn’t replace this — in fact i’m curious about making tools that provide access to knowledge about real-time and historical team activity, how this can inform team members… i.e. more-informed shoulder-taps

Rob mentioned “conceptual design”
